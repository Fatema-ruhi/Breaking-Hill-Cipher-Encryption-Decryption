# Breaking Hill Cipher Encryption Using Linear Algebra

A cryptanalysis project demonstrating vulnerabilities in the classical Hill Cipher and its modified variants using known plaintext attacks and linear algebra techniques.

## 📖 Overview

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929. While it was innovative for its time, utilizing linear algebra and modular arithmetic, this project demonstrates its fundamental vulnerability to known plaintext attacks due to its linearity property.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement classical Hill Cipher encryption and decryption
- Demonstrate known plaintext attack to recover encryption keys
- Analyze the security of two modified Hill Cipher variants
- Investigate whether modified methods can resist cryptanalytic attacks

## 🔍 Key Findings

**Classical Hill Cipher Vulnerability:**
- The cipher encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks
- Once attackers know plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the key can be recovered through matrix operations
- The linearity property makes it susceptible to known plaintext attacks

**Modified Variants Analysis:**
1. **Hill Cipher with XOR and Radix64 Encoding** - Still vulnerable as the first three steps can be reversed without the key
2. **Hill Cipher with Circulant Matrices** - Marginally better but still breakable due to inherent linearity

**Conclusion:** Hill Cipher cryptography remains fundamentally insecure regardless of modifications, as long as the linearity property persists.

## 🧮 Algorithm

### Classical Hill Cipher

**Encryption:**
```
C = (K × P) mod 26
```
Where:
- `C` = Ciphertext matrix
- `K` = Key matrix (must be invertible mod 26)
- `P` = Plaintext matrix
- Operations performed modulo 26 (for alphabet)

**Decryption:**
```
P = (K⁻¹ × C) mod 26
```
Where `K⁻¹` is the modular multiplicative inverse of K.

### Known Plaintext Attack

Given plaintext-ciphertext pairs:

1. **Organize Data:**
   - Create plaintext matrix `P` with linearly independent columns
   - Create corresponding ciphertext matrix `C`

2. **Solve for Key:**
   ```
   C = K × P (mod 26)
   C × P⁻¹ = K (mod 26)
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - Test the recovered key on additional plaintext-ciphertext pairs
   - Check if decryption produces correct plaintext

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Encryption/Decryption

```python
from hill_cipher import HillCipher
import numpy as np

# Define a 2x2 key matrix
key = np.array([[3, 3], [2, 5]])

# Create cipher instance
cipher = HillCipher(key)

# Encrypt
plaintext = "HELLO"
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
print(f"Ciphertext: {ciphertext}")

# Decrypt
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted}")
```

### Known Plaintext Attack

```python
from attack import known_plaintext_attack

# Known plaintext-ciphertext pairs
plaintext = "areyareadykids"
ciphertext = "CORRESPONDINGCIPHERTEXT"

# Recover the key
recovered_key = known_plaintext_attack(plaintext, ciphertext, block_size=2)
print(f"Recovered Key:\n{recovered_key}")
```

## 📊 Example: SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song

The project includes a complete demonstration using the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song lyrics as plaintext to show how the known plaintext attack successfully recovers encryption keys.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Matrix Requirements
- Key matrix must be invertible in modulo 26
- Determinant must be coprime with 26 (gcd(det(K), 26) = 1)
- For attack: plaintext columns must be linearly independent

### Modular Arithmetic
- All operations performed in Z₂₆ (integers modulo 26)
- Uses extended Euclidean algorithm for modular inverse computation
- Matrix inversion follows standard linear algebra with modular constraints

## 📚 Mathematical Foundation

The security weakness stems from the encryption being a **linear transformation**:

```
E(aP₁ + bP₂) = aE(P₁) + bE(P₂)
```

This linearity allows attackers to:
1. Set up systems of linear equations from known plaintext-ciphertext pairs
2. Solve for the key matrix using standard linear algebra
3. Bypass the intended security without brute force

## 🔐 Security Implications

This project demonstrates why:
- Hill Cipher should **NOT** be used for real-world encryption
- Linear encryption schemes are fundamentally vulnerable
- Modern cryptography requires non-linear transformations
- Kerckhoffs's Principle: "Security should depend solely on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm"
